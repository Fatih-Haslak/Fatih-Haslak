## Hi, I'm Fatih 👋

I work on **Computer Vision** and **LLMs**, building real-world AI systems (detection, tracking, segmentation, anomaly detection, pose, deployment).

- Focus: Vision + LLM / VLM, PyTorch, Transformers
- Interest: real-time & edge AI (Jetson, TensorRT, FP16)
- Goal: I want to work in **Istanbul** on applied AI/robotics projects.
